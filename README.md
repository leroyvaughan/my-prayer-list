# My Second VueJs App: prayerlist-vuecli
This is my second VueJs app.  It was inspired from the video tutorial at Udemy.com : [The Complete Vue JS Developer Course â€“ inc. Vue JS 2!](https://www.udemy.com/course/vue-js-2-the-full-guide-by-real-apps-vuex-router-node/).

```
For this app, I use a more advanced method of data Store object and also used the Bulma Css
 framework (lightly), only because it is what he started the project with.  Actually, I prefer
 Bootstrap but thought I would try something new.
